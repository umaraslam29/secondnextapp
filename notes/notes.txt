* intially for routes in next pages folder was uses wherein each js file in a folder will be a page 
    but in the latest version we create a folder inside the app directory and after that we create a page.js file which will be a page 

    for ex in the app --> about(folder) ---> page.js = /about


* for layouts in the previous version we had a _app.js file which will include headers and navs
    in the latest version we have a file called layout.js we can include components in there to reflect in all the pages also we can incllude 
    layout.js in seperate folders to be reflected in the seperate routes
